NAME
    Business::CyberSource - Perl interface to the CyberSource Simple Order
    SOAP API

VERSION
    version v0.4.2

DESCRIPTION
    This library is a Perl interface to the CyberSource Simple Order SOAP
    API built on Moose and XML::Compile::SOAP technologies. This library
    aims to eventually provide a full interface the SOAPI.

    You may wish to read the Official CyberSource Documentation on Credit
    Card Services for the Simpler Order API
    <http://apps.cybersource.com/library/documentation/dev_guides/CC_Svcs_SO
    _API/html/> as it will provide further information on why what some
    things are and the general workflow.

    To get started you will want to read the documentation in
    Business::CyberSource::Request. If you find any documentation unclear or
    outright missing, please file a bug.

    If there are features that are part of CyberSource's API but are not
    documented, or are missing here, please file a bug. I'll be happy to add
    them, but due to the size of the upstream API, I have not had time to
    cover all the features and some are currently undocumented.

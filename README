NAME
    Business::CyberSource - Perl interface to the CyberSource Simple Order
    SOAP API

VERSION
    version 0.009000

DESCRIPTION
    This library is a Perl interface to the CyberSource Simple Order SOAP
    API built on Moose and XML::Compile::SOAP technologies. This library
    aims to eventually provide a full interface the SOAPI.

    You may wish to read the Official CyberSource Documentation on Credit
    Card Services for the Simpler Order API
    <http://apps.cybersource.com/library/documentation/dev_guides/CC_Svcs_SO
    _API/html/> as it will provide further information on why what some
    things are and the general workflow.

    To get started you will want to read the documentation in
    Business::CyberSource::Client and Business::CyberSource::Request. If you
    find any documentation unclear or outright missing, please file a bug.

    If there are features that are part of CyberSource's API but are not
    documented, or are missing here, please file a bug. I'll be happy to add
    them, but due to the size of the upstream API, I have not had time to
    cover all the features and some are currently undocumented.

ENVIRONMENT

            }
            catch {
                    carp $_;
            };
            return unless $auth_response;

            unless( $auth_response->is_accept ) {
                    carp $auth_response->reason_text;
            }
            else {
                    my $capture_request
                            = Business::CyberSource::Request::Capture->new({
                                    reference_code => $auth_response->reference_code,
                                    service => {
                                            request_id => $auth_response->request_id,
                                    },
                                    purchase_totals => {
                                            total    => $auth_response->auth->amount,
                                            currency => $auth_response->purchase_totals->currency,
                                    },
                            });

                    my $capture_response;
                    try {
                            $capture_response = $client->submit( $capture_request );
                    }
                    catch {
                            carp $_;
                    };
                    return unless $capture_response;

                    if ( $capture_response->is_accept ) {
                            # you probably want to record this
                            say $capture_response->capture->reconciliation_id;
                    }
            }

    This code is not meant to be DRY, but more of a top to bottom example.
    Also note that if you really want to do Authorization and Capture at one
    time use a Sale. Most common Reasons for Exceptions would be bad input
    into the request object (which validates things) or CyberSource just
    randomly throwing an ERROR, in which case you can usually just retry
    later. You don't have to print the response on error during development,
    you can easily just use the "REMOTE_CLIENT_DEBUG" Environment variable.

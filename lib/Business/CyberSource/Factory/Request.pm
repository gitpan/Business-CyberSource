=head1 DESCRIPTION

This Module is to provide a replacement for what
L<Business::CyberSource::Request> originally was, a factory. Once backwards
compatibility is no longer needed this code may be removed.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new

=head2 create

	$factory->create( $implementation, { ... } )

Create a new request object. C<create> takes a request implementation and a hashref to pass to the
implementation's C<new> method. The implementation string accepts any
implementation whose package name is prefixed by
C<Business::CyberSource::Request::>.

	my $req = $factory->create(
			'Capture',
			{
				first_name => 'John',
				last_name  => 'Smith',
				...
			}
		);

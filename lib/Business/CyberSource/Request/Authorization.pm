=head1 DESCRIPTION

Offline authorization means that when you submit an order using a credit card,
you will not know if the funds are available until you capture the order and
receive confirmation of payment. You typically will not ship the goods until
you receive this payment confirmation. For offline credit cards, it will take
typically five days longer to receive payment confirmation than for online
cards.

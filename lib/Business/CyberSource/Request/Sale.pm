=head1 DESCRIPTION

A sale is a bundled authorization and capture. You can use a sale instead of a
separate authorization and capture if there is no delay between taking a
customer's order and shipping the goods. A sale is typically used for
electronic goods and for services that you can turn on immediately.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 capture_service

Sale does both authorization and capture and so needs another service
attribute. It is built for you and cannot be modified.

=head1 EXTENDS

L<Business::CyberSource::Request::Authorization>

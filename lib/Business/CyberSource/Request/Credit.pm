=head1 DESCRIPTION

This object allows you to create a request for a credit. If you do not want to
apply traits (or are using the Request factory) then you can instantiate either the
L<Business::CyberSource::Request::StandAloneCredit> or the
L<Business::CyberSource::Request::FollowOnCredit>.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 with_traits

on credits require that you specify a C<request_id> in order to work.

=head2 new

Instantiates a credit request object, see L<the attributes listed below|/ATTRIBUTES>
for which ones are required and which are optional.

=head2 submit

Actually sends the required data to CyberSource for processing and returns a
L<Business::CyberSource::Response> object.

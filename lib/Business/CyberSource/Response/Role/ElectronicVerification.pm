=head1 NAME

Business::CyberSource::Response::Role::ElectronicVerification - Electronic Verification Information

=head1 VERSION

version 0.010003

=head1 DESCRIPTION

When performing Authorization requests for American Express credit cards for some processors
CyberSource will respond with Electronic Verification Information.  This Role implements support
for them.

All attributes have values according to CyberSource's documentation available at
L<http://apps.cybersource.com/library/documentation/dev_guides/CC_Svcs_SO_API/Credit_Cards_SO_API.pdf>

There are two types of attributes, B<raw> are values specified by your payment processor while
all other attributes are mapped by CyberSource from values specified by the payment processor.
It is strongly recommended that you avoid the raw values if possible to account for differences
in payment processors.

The possible values for the mapped fields include (shamelessly taken from CyberSource's Documentation):

=over 4

=item 'N'

No, the data does not match.

=item 'P'

The processor did not return verification information.

=item 'R'

The system is unavailable, so retry.

=item 'S'

The verification service is not available.

=item 'U'

Verification information is not available.

=item 'Y'

Yes, the data matches.

=item '2'

The processor returned an unrecognized value.

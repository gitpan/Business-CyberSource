=head1 NAME

Business::CyberSource::Exception::Response - response thrown as an object because of ERROR state

=head1 VERSION

version 0.010001

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	use Try::Tiny;
	use Safe::Isa;

	try { ... }
	catch {
		if ( $_->$_does('Business::CyberSource::Response::Role::Base) )
			# log reason_text
		}
	};

=head1 DESCRIPTION

do not catch this object, should Moose provide an exception role at some
point, we will remove this class in favor of applying the role to
L<Business::CyberSource::Response> instead catch
L<Business::CyberSource::Response::Role::Base>

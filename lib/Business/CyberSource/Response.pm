=head1 NAME

Business::CyberSource::Response - Response Object

=head1 VERSION

version v0.2.3

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Every time you call C<submit> on a request object it returns a response
object. This response can be used to determine the success of a transaction,
as well as receive a follow up C<request_id> in case you need to do further
actions with this. A response will always have C<decision>, C<reason_code>,
C<reason_text>, and C<request_id> attributes. You should always use either
introspection or check the C<decision> to determine which attributes will be
defined, as what is returned by CyberSource varies depending on what the
C<decision> is and what was sent in the request itself.

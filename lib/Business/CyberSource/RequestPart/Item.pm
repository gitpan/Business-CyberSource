=head1 NAME

Business::CyberSource::RequestPart::Item - Item Helper Class

=head1 VERSION

version 0.006001

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 unit_price

Per-item price of the product. You must include either this field or
L<total|Business::CyberSource::RequestPart::PurchaseTotals/"total">
in your request.

=head2 quantity

The default is 1. For C<ccAuthService> and C<ccCaptureService>, this field is
required if L<product_code|/"product_code> is not default or one of the values related to
shipping and/or handling.

=head2 product_code

Type of product. This value is used to determine the category that the product
is in.

=head2 product_name

For C<ccAuthService> and C<ccCaptureService>, this field is required if
L<product_code|/product_code> is not default or one of the values related to shipping
and/or handling.

=head2 product_sku

Identification code for the product. For C<ccAuthService> and
C<ccCaptureService>, this field is required if L<product_code|/product_code>
is not default or one of the values related to shipping and/or handling.

=head2 product_risk

=head2 tax_amount

Total tax to apply to the product. This value cannot be negative. The tax
amount and the offer amount must be in the same currency.
The tax amount field is additive. For example (in CyberSource notation):

You include the following offer lines in your request:

	item_0_unitPrice=10.00
	item_0_quantity=1
	item_0_taxAmount=0.80
	item_1_unitPrice=20.00
	item_1_quantity=1
	item_1_taxAmount=1.60

The total amount authorized will be 32.40, not 30.00 with 2.40 of tax included.

=head2 tax_rate

=head2 national_tax
